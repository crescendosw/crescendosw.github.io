<h1>Crescendo Software LLC Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>What kinds of information is collected?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>None of the apps or websites produced by Crescendo Software LLC gather any personal information from users.</li>
<li>A user may select a church within an application, but this selection is only recorded locally
    on that device and never transmitted to Crescendo Software.</li>
  <li>If and only if a music leader contacts Crescendo Software LLC and expresses a desire to publish a weekly song list,
      the music leader's contact information will be stored by Crescendo Software LLC only for purposes of corresponding
    about each week's song list, and only until such time as the music leader no longer wishes to publish weekly
    song lists in the app.</li>
  <li>Crescendo Software LLC may ask a music leader for information about their church to determine the existence
      of the church prior to registration.  Such information will be recorded by Crescendo Software LLC.</li>
  <li>If a user contacts Crescendo Software LLC for support, their contact information will not be published,
sold, or otherwise divulged to anyone.</li>
  <li>Crescendo Software LLC does not use cookies or otherwise collect any information about users who visit
    the website.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How does your Organisation use this information?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If the music leader for a church chooses to contact Crescendo Software LLC in order to register a new church,
the name of the church will be displayed within the app and the songs they select to publish each week will
be visible to any user of the app who selects that church.</li>
      <li>No attempt will be made to verify that a user is a member of a given church.</li>
    <li>Weekly song lists are for educational purposes only so that
users are better prepared to sing their part in an upcoming church service.</li>
    <li>Music leaders who have registered a church will be contacted periodically as needed in order to
        request weekly song lists for publishing within the app, only until such time as the music leader
        decides to unregister the church.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Crescendo Software LLC does not sell or otherwise disclose the contact information of any user,
      music leader, or church.</li>
    <li>Church information recorded as a part of the church registration process will not be divulged to anyone
    other than the church name itself being displayed within the app.  Besides the weekly song list, no other
        information about the church will be displayed within the app.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Changes to the privacy policy may be made from time to time.</li>
  <li>Such changes will always be posted to this web page.</li>
