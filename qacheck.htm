            <li>a correct note but the wrong octave</li>
            <li>a default tempo that is way off</li>
            <li>a note or rest held too long or to short</li>
            <li>a tie that is played as two individual, repeated notes</li>
            <li>the piano accompaniment plays instead of the vocal part</li>

    <p><strong>What if it is a unison song?</strong><br>
