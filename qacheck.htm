    Any kind of error.  Here are examples:
        <ul>
            <li>incorrect accidentals</li>
            <li>a correct note but the wrong octave</li>
            <li>a default tempo that is way off</li>
            <li>a note or rest held too long or to short</li>
            <li>a tie that is played as two individual, repeated notes</li>
            <li>the piano accompaniment plays instead of the vocal part</li>
            <li>any other kind of musical error</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Why are all the buttons on the sign-up sheet all greyed out and unresponsive?</strong><br>
    You need to log in to Coda.  You may have to create a Coda account.</p>

    <p><strong>What if it is a unison song?</strong><br>
    The soprano should check the songs sung in unison.  If you are an Alto, Tenor, or Bass, click the green Finished Checking Song button and go to the next song.  </p>
